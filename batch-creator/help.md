Created it so that it can provide me with a batch file which is capable of doing following tasks when executed:
1. Activates the specified virtual-environment for my django project.
2. Open my django project onto the command-line.

It saves me the hassle to **create a batch-file**, which saves me the hassle to **move to the venv/scripts to activate virtual-env** and then **move command line back to my django project directory which contain the manage.py file**.
